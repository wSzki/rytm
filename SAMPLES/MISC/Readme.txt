
The Feed Your Rytm (FYR) content consist of:

(1) the "AR FYR Project" Sysex - one Project with 89 sounds, only using synthesis and factory samples. 17 example patterns included.
	Load this into a new project of your Rytm and save the sounds you like.

(2) 30 sample chains, both standard and single cycle wave forms. The normal sample chains are sampled and created originally from 
	the Hollowsun library (i.e. ancient hardware samples, free on the web in the 2000s) then processed by the TAL Sampler plugin. 
	
	The looped single cycle waves can be used to synthesize various sounds. They are mostly from the AKWF collection. I am 
	still not sure whether this works as it should, the results I got are very much usable, but the waves still have to be tuned, 
	this may be the effect of converting sample rates from 44.1 to 48 in OctaChainer

(3) Chord OSC samples
	These are 15 short samples created using top notch software synths like Diva and Bazille. These should be looped and be used to 
	create chords within Rytm.

All content can be used free of charge in your projects.

Enjoy,
